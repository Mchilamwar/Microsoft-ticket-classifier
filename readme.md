### Classification of Priority of Support Query Tickets Based on Content Present In Query

* A lot of human effort is spent unnecessarily every day just to re-prioritize the incoming support tickets to their deserving priority, because everyone just creates them either as Priority-2 or Priority-1.

* This issue can be solved to some extent if we had a predictive model which can classify the incoming tickets into P1/P2/P3 ,etc. based on the text contained in them.

* The Basic idea of this project is to automate the priority prediction based on content using text mining and vectorizing the textual data using TF-IDF Vectorizer and further developing classification model based on Classification Algorithms like LogisticRegression,Naive Bayes etc.
